 Contains an example of every public facing SDK function call added by CioFirebaseWrapper.
 This file helps us prevent introducing breaking changes to the SDK by accident. If a public
 function of the SDK is modified, this test class will not successfully compile. By not compiling,
 that is a reminder to either fix the compilation and introduce the breaking change or fix the
 mistake and not introduce the breaking change in the code base.

 Note: This test is skipped at runtime but must compile to verify the public API.
